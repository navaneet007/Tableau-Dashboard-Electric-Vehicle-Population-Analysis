# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

### ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) population data to understand the adoption patterns, market share, and performance of electric vehicles across various states. The dashboard provides clear insights into EV growth, distribution, and manufacturer trends.

### ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Electric vehicles have rapidly evolved as a sustainable alternative to conventional vehicles. However, understanding their adoption patterns, manufacturer dominance, and performance metrics is key for future policy and business decisions.

This analysis focuses on:
1. Measuring total EV population (BEVs + PHEVs)
2. Assessing technological efficiency (Average Electric Range)
3. Identifying top EV manufacturers and models
4. Understanding geographical distribution by state
5. Evaluating the impact of CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility

### ðŸ§  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Vehicles:** Overall count of electric vehicles (BEV + PHEV)  
2. **Average Electric Range:** Average distance covered per charge  
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEVs:** Market share of Battery Electric Vehicles  
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEVs:** Market share of Plug-in Hybrids  
5. **Total Vehicles by Model Year (2010 Onwards):** Trend analysis of EV growth  
6. **Total Vehicles by State:** EV distribution across U.S. states  
7. **Top 10 Vehicles by Make:** Leading manufacturers by count  
8. **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility:** Policy-based adoption insights  
9. **Top 10 Vehicles by Model:** Most popular EV models
